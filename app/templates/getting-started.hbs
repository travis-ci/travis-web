        <h2>Activate GitHub Repositories</h2>
        <p>Once you're signed in, and we've initially synchronized your repositories from GitHub, go to your {{#link-to "profile" id="profile-page-link"}}profile{{/link-to}} page for open source or for your private projects.</p>
        <p>You'll see all the organizations you're a member of and all the repositories you have access to. The ones you have administrative access to are the ones you can enable the service hook for.</p>
        <p>Flip the switch to on for all repositories you'd like to enable.</p>

        <h2>Add .travis.yml file to your repository</h2>
        <p>In order for Travis CI to build your project, you need to tell the systems a little bit about it. You'll need to add a file named .travis.yml to the root of your repository.</p>
        <p>If .travis.yml is not in the repository, is misspelled or is not valid YAML, Travis CI will ignore it.</p>
        <p>Here you can find some of our basic <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/language-specific/" title="">language examples</a>.</p>

        <h2>Trigger your first build with a git push</h2>
        <p>Once the GitHub hook is set up, push your commit that adds .travis.yml to your repository. That should add a build into one of the queues on Travis CI and your build will start as soon as one worker for your language is available.</p>
        <p>To start a build, perform one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Commit and push something to your repository</li>
          <li>Go to your repository's settings page, click on "Webhooks & Services" on the left menu, choose "Travis CI" in the "Services", and use the "Test service" button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note note--info">
          <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot trigger your first build using Test Hook button. It has to be triggered by a push to your repository.
