          Just a few more seconds as we talk to {{vcs-name this.user.vcsType}} to find out which repositories belong to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're part of an {{vcs-vocab this.user.vcsType 'organization' lower=true}} that already has repositories set up on Travis CI, we'll take you to the list once we're done.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not part of any existing {{vcs-vocab this.user.vcsType 'organization' lower=true plural=true}} yet, we'll take you to a handy getting started guide to get you off the ground quickly.
