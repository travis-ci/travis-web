|
| Screens in Tailwind are translated to CSS media queries. They define the
| responsive breakpoints for your project. By default Tailwind takes a
| "mobile first" approach, where each screen size represents a minimum
| viewport width. Feel free to have as few or as many screens as you
| want, naming them in whatever way you'd prefer for your project.
|
| Tailwind also allows for more complex screen definitions, which can be
| useful in certain situations. Be sure to see the full responsive
| documentation for a complete list of options.
